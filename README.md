# 0x16. C - Simple Shell
Simple Shell Project
Introduction
This is a simple shell project written in C that emulates the basic functionality of a command-line shell. It provides a minimalistic command-line interface where users can enter commands and execute them. The shell supports basic command execution, command-line arguments, and some built-in commands.

Features
Command Execution: The shell can execute external commands by forking a child process and executing the command.
Command-Line Arguments: Users can provide command-line arguments to the executed commands, similar to a typical shell.
Built-in Commands: The shell supports a few built-in commands such as exit (terminate the shell).
